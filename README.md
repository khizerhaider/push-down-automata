# 🧠 Pushdown Automaton (PDA) Simulator

An educational and interactive Python-based **Pushdown Automaton Simulator** with GUI. Designed for students, instructors, and CS enthusiasts to **design**, **test**, and **visualize** pushdown automata (PDA) and how they process context-free languages.

## 📸 Features

### ✅ PDA Design
- Define states, alphabets, and stack symbols via an intuitive GUI
- Configure transitions using a standardized format
- Built-in examples like balanced parentheses PDA

### 🔍 Simulation Modes
- **Instant Simulation**: Quickly test if a string is accepted or rejected
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Follow each configuration transition
- **Animated Visualization**: Watch PDA execution in real time

### 📊 Visual Tools
- **Input tape** with live tracking
- **Stack display** showing operations (push/pop)
- **State tracker** with transition logs
- Color-coded interface for clarity and accessibility

### 🎓 Educational Use
- Immediate feedback on student-designed PDAs
- Ideal for classroom demos or assignments
- Multiple learning styles supported via textual and visual outputs

## 🏗 Architecture

The GUI is organized into **three main tabs**:
1. **PDA Definition** – Define states, alphabets, stack symbols, and transitions.
2. **Simulation** – Run full or step-by-step tests on input strings.
3. **Visual Simulation** – Animated PDA execution with stack and tape visualization.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install requirements** (typically only requires `tkinter`, which is included in standard Python distributions):
   ```bash
   python your_script.py
Use the GUI:

        Go to PDA Definition Tab

        Click Load Example or enter your own configuration

        Click Update PDA

        Go to Simulation Tab or Visual Simulation Tab to test strings

📘 Transition Format
current_state,input_symbol,stack_top → next_state,stack_push
Examples:
          q0,ε,ε → q1,ε      # Initialization
          q1,(,$ → q1,($     # Push '(' on empty stack
          q1,),( → q1,ε      # Pop '(' when ')' is read
          q1,ε,$ → q2,ε      # Accept if only $ remains
🛠 Key Functionalities

    Epsilon (ε) transitions supported

    Stack operations: push, pop, or no-op

    Step-by-step breakdown with transitions, state, stack

    Speed controls for visual simulations

    Error validation and transition debugging

🧪 Example Use Case

    Define a PDA to accept balanced parentheses

    Input: ((()))

    Run in step-by-step mode to observe:

        State transitions

        Stack growth and shrinkage

        Input consumption

🧑‍🏫 For Educators and Students

    Demonstrate PDA concepts in class

    Let students build and test their own automata

    Use built-in examples to explore standard CFLs

❗ Important Notes

    Always click Update PDA after making changes

    Use ε for epsilon transitions (not a blank field)

    $ is automatically used as the stack bottom marker

    Format transitions exactly (with spaces around →)

🐞 Troubleshooting

    "PDA not properly defined": Check state and transition definitions

    "Invalid transition format": Ensure correct syntax and symbols

    Simulation issues: Use step-by-step mode to debug transitions
